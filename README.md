# V2Ray Server Config Archive

This repository contains a collection of publicly shared V2Ray server configurations, extracted from open Telegram channels for personal and educational use.

## 🤝 Why This Repository?

This project is **open-source**, completely **free**, and built with the goal of helping ordinary people — especially students, researchers, and individuals in restricted regions — to access the open internet more easily for their **daily, academic, and scientific needs**.

We believe in **free flow of information**, equal access to online educational resources, and the right to digital inclusion for everyone.  
This repository is a small volunteer effort in that direction. 💙

## 🔄 Auto Update

The configs are updated automatically using a Python script that scrapes posts from public Telegram channels.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `configs/`: Collected config files (timestamped).
- `seen_hashes.txt`: SHA256 hashes of already-seen posts to avoid duplicates.
- `counter.txt`: Run counter for versioning.
- `script.py`: Python script for scraping and saving.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is maintained for **educational**, **research**, and **archival** purposes only.  
We **do not** operate, control, or promote any of the servers listed here. All configurations are publicly available online.  
**Use at your own discretion and risk.**
