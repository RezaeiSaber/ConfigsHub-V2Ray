# 🌐 V2Ray Server Config Archive

This repository is a **public archive** of free V2Ray server configuration links, extracted from public Telegram channels for **personal, educational, and research purposes**.

We **do not run or promote** any of these servers — all configurations are freely available online and collected automatically.

---

## 💡 Why This Exists?

In countries with internet restrictions, researchers, students, and ordinary users often struggle to access educational content.  
This project is an open-source initiative to help bridge that gap by providing easy access to public server configurations.

We believe in:
- 🌍 Free access to information  
- 📚 Equal access to educational resources  
- 🔓 Digital inclusion for everyone

## 🔄 Auto-Updated
